Q4 vs Q3 Comparison Results
============================

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 4.990101e-2
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 2.233853e-1
Maximum absolute difference: 0.927375
Correlation coefficient (original): 0.402070
Correlation coefficient (normalized): 0.402070
Signal-to-Noise Ratio: -20.76 dB

Interpretation:
---------------
✗ Low correlation (normalized) - significant waveform differences

Note: Normalized correlation (0.402) adjusts for amplitude differences,
      providing a better measure of waveform shape similarity.
      Original correlation (0.402) is affected by both amplitude and shape.
~ Low SNR - noticeable difference

Method differences:
-------------------
Q3 (Time-domain):
  - Uses 8th-order Butterworth filters (non-ideal)
  - IIR filter implementation (Direct Form II)
  - Non-linear phase response
  - Gradual transition band

Q4 (Frequency-domain):
  - Uses ideal brick-wall filters
  - Frequency-domain multiplication
  - No phase distortion from filters
  - Sharp cutoff
